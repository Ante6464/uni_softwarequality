Continuous attribution studies that examine the connections between weather phenomena and climate change confirm this. For example, a report by World Weather Attribution found that the likelihood of heatwaves has increased 30-fold since the 19th century. Additionally, an attribution study conducted by the UK's Met Office reveals that the risk of unprecedented heatwaves in India and Pakistan has increased 100-fold due to climate change.\".

We can identify that the text is about climate change and heatwaves in South Asia.\n\nStep 2: Now we need to identify the key phrases in the text, which are: \"climate change is intensifying heatwaves\", \"connections between weather phenomena and climate change\", \"likelihood of heatwaves\", \"risk of unprecedented heatwaves\". These phrases give us the most important information about the topic.\n\nStep 3: We can identify the tone of the text, which is neutral. The text does not express a subjective opinion, but rather presents factual information.\n\nStep 4: Now that we have identified the main subjects, key phrases, and tone, we can start translating the text. We can start by translating the key phrases and then move on to the rest of the text.\n\nStep 5: We can start translating the key phrases: \"There is no question that climate change is intensifying heatwaves in South Asia.\" This translates to: \"Keine Frage, dass die Klimaver\u00e4nderung die Hitze wellen in S\u00fcdasien verst\u00e4rkt.\" \n\nStep 6: Next, we can translate the sentence: \"Continuous attribution studies that examine the connections between weather phenomena and climate change confirm this.\" This translates to: \"Studien zur kontinuierlichen Attribuierung, die die Verbindungen zwischen Wetterph\u00e4nomenen und den Klimaver\u00e4nderungen untersuchen, best\u00e4tigen dies.\" \n\nStep 7: Now, we can translate the sentence: \"For example, a report by World Weather Attribution found that the likelihood of heatwaves has increased 30-fold since the 19th century.\" This translates to: \"Beispielsweise fand eine Berichterstattung durch World Weather Attribution fest, dass die Wahrscheinlichkeit von Hitze wellen seit dem 19. Jahrhundert um 30-fach gestiegen ist.\" \n\nStep 8: Next, we can translate the sentence: \"Additionally, an attribution study conducted by the UK's Met Office reveals that the risk of unprecedented heatwaves in India and Pakistan has increased 100-fold due to"},"reference_text":{"0":"Dass der Klimawandel die Hitzewellen in S\u00fcdasien verst\u00e4rkt, steht au\u00dfer Frage.

So ergab ein Bericht von World Weather Attribution, dass die Wahrscheinlichkeit f\u00fcr Hitzewellen seit dem 19. Jahrhundert 30-fach erh\u00f6ht ist.
