This is not up for debate. New attribution studies that investigate the relationships between weather phenomena and the climate change, prove it. For example, a report by World Weather Attribution showed that the probability of heatwaves since the 19th century has increased 30 times.

This is not up for debate. New attribution studies that investigate the relationships between weather phenomena and the climate change, prove it. For example, a report by World Weather Attribution showed that the probability of heatwaves since the 19th century has increased 30 times.

So, \"that the climate change is increasing the heatwaves in South Asia\" is a bit awkward. It's better to say \"The climate change is increasing the heatwaves in South Asia.\"\n* \"Au\u00dfer Frage\" is an idiomatic expression that means \"not up for debate\". However, it's not always translatable, and in this context, \"that's clear\" or \"that's evident\" might be a better option.\n*"},"reference_text":{"0":"There is no question that climate change is intensifying heatwaves in South Asia. Continuous attribution studies that examine the connections between weather phenomena and climate change confirm this. For example, a report by World Weather Attribution found that the likelihood of heatwaves has increased 30-fold since the 19th century. Additionally, an attribution study conducted by the UK's Met Office reveals that the risk of unprecedented heatwaves in India and Pakistan has increased 100-fold due to climate change."},"metrics":{"0":{"BLEU":10.1654158177,"chrF":48.8349951792,"rougeL":29.0076335878,"MetricX":14.1875}},"prompt_language":{"0":"German"}}
