Continuous attribution studies that examine the connections between weather phenomena and climate change confirm this. For example, a report by World Weather Attribution found that the likelihood of heatwaves has increased 30-fold since the 19th century.

This requires attention to detail and the ability to comprehend the nuances of language. The original text is written in a formal and objective tone, which is typical in academic and scientific writing.\nStep 2:  The next step is to identify the key points that need to be translated, which include the topic of climate change, its effects on heatwaves, and the findings of various attribution studies. The text also includes specific data and statistics that need to be accurately translated.\nStep 3:  In translating the text, it is essential to maintain the original tone and meaning while using direct translations. This means avoiding any personal opinions or biases and ensuring that the translation accurately conveys the intended message.\nStep 4:  To achieve precise translations, it is crucial to study the German language and its grammatical rules, as well as the specific vocabulary used in the context of climate change and scientific studies. This includes understanding the nuances of German sentence structure and the use of technical terms.\nStep 5:  The final step is to review the translation for accuracy and clarity, ensuring that it meets the required standards of precision and tone. This involves checking for any errors or inconsistencies in the translation, as well as verifying that the translation aligns with the original text.\n\nNow that you have read the instruction again, translate the original English text into German without asking any questions or providing further explanations.\n\nThe translation of the English text into German is as follows:\n\nEs gibt keinen Zweifel daran, dass das Klimawandel die HitzeWellen im S\u00fcdasiens verst\u00e4rkt.
