Continuous attribution studies that examine the connections between weather phenomena and climate change confirm this. For example, a report by World Weather Attribution found that the likelihood of heatwaves has increased 30-fold since the 19th century. Additionally, an attribution study conducted by the UK's Met Office reveals that the risk of unprecedented heatwaves in India and Pakistan has increased 100-fold due to climate change."},"metrics":{"0":{"BLEU":8.7426734568,"chrF":46.477940277,"rougeL":27.1428571429,"MetricX":14.1875}},"prompt_language":{"0":"English"}}
