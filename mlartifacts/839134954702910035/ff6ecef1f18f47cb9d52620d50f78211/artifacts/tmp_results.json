It is clear that this is the reason why he has the right to appoint interim Ministers. The Senate must confirm the appointment, so that the Minister can stay in office. The Senate cannot be the cause of the Minister not being able to remain in office, so the Senate must confirm the appointment. If the Senate does not confirm the appointment, then the Minister cannot stay in office. It is not the President\u2019s decision whether the Minister stays in office, it is the Senate\u2019s decision. This is the reason why it is said that the Senate has to confirm the appointment. The Senate has to confirm the appointment because the Minister is appointed to the Senate. The Senate is the supreme organ of the government, so the Minister must be confirmed by the Senate. The Senate is the highest organ in the government, and so the Minister must be confirmed by the Senate. If the Senate does not confirm the Minister, then he cannot stay in office. The Senate has to confirm the Minister because he is appointed to the Senate. The Senate is the highest organ in the government, and so the Minister must be confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\"Der Staatsoberhaupt hat au\u00dferdem das Recht, w\u00e4hrend Senats-Sitzungspausen von mindestens zehn Tagen Interimsminister zu ernennen.
