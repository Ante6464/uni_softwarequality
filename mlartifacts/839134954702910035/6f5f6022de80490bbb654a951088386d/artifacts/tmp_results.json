The reason for my resignation is the treatment and behaviour of the new head of department, Mr Schneider, towards me, which I cannot accept.\n\nI have worked for your company for more than 15 years and have always been satisfied with the working conditions and the way I was treated. However, this has changed drastically since the arrival of Mr Schneider. He has repeatedly ignored my work and has not recognised the efforts I have made to complete projects and tasks on schedule.\n\nFurthermore, Mr Schneider has made it clear that he does not appreciate my expertise and has not been willing to listen to my suggestions and ideas for improving the department's performance. Instead, he has preferred to rely on the opinions and recommendations of junior staff members, whose knowledge and experience are not comparable to my own.\n\nI cannot accept this treatment and behaviour towards me, and I believe it is unfair and unjust. I feel that my contributions to the company are not valued, and I do not want to continue working in a department where my efforts are not recognised and appreciated.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the opportunities that you have given me during my time at the company. I have valued my time here and the relationships that I have built with my colleagues. I hope that you will be able to find a suitable replacement for me and that the transition will be smooth and seamless"},"reference_text":{"0":"Der Staatschef hat zugleich aber das Recht, vorl\u00e4ufig Minister w\u00e4hrend mindestens zehn Tage langen Sitzungspausen des Senats einzusetzen.
