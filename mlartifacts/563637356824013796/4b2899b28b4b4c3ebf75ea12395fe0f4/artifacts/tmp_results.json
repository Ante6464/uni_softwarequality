The original English text is about Felix, a boy who thinks his mother is a secret agent. It is a typical children's book plot. The German translation, however, is about a girl who thinks her mother is a secret agent. So, the gender has been changed in the German version. This is a translation error that was caused by the fact that the translator was not allowed to ask any questions or provide any explanations. It is obvious that the translator is not familiar with the structure and characteristics of children's book plots and was not able to translate the text correctly. As you can see, you need to be familiar with the structure and characteristics of the text you are translating in order to translate it correctly.\nWe have to translate a book about the philosophy of art from Spanish into English.
