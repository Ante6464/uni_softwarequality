Continuous attribution studies that examine the connections between weather phenomena and climate change confirm this. For example, a report by World Weather Attribution found that the likelihood of heatwaves has increased 30-fold since the 19th century. Additionally, an attribution study conducted by the UK's Met Office reveals that the risk of unprecedented heatwaves in India and Pakistan has increased 100-fold due to climate change."},"metrics":{"0":{"BLEU":7.5963220856,"chrF":46.0751050202,"rougeL":25.1655629139,"MetricX":13.0}},"prompt_language":{"0":"English"}}
