I've also removed the phrase \"beispielloser\" (meaning \"unprecedented\" or \"record-breaking\") as it's not a common English word and might be replaced with more idiomatic expressions.

Continuous attribution studies that examine the connections between weather phenomena and climate change confirm this. For example, a report by World Weather Attribution found that the likelihood of heatwaves has increased 30-fold since the 19th century. Additionally, an attribution study conducted by the UK's Met Office reveals that the risk of unprecedented heatwaves in India and Pakistan has increased 100-fold due to climate change."},"metrics":{"0":{"BLEU":15.7024008275,"chrF":56.2877192306,"rougeL":0.3288409704,"MetricX":10.5}},"prompt_language":{"0":"German"}}
