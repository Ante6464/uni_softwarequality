New attribution studies, which investigate the connections between weather phenomena and climate change, confirm this. A report by World Weather Attribution found that the likelihood of heat waves has increased 30 times since the 19th century. And a study conducted by the British Met Office shows that the risk of unprecedented heat waves in India and Pakistan has increased by a hundredfold due to climate change.  The original text's last word \"Klimawandel\" is translated as \"due to climate change\". The word before the last word is \"den\". The word before \"den\" is \"Klimawandel\" again. According to the examples, \"Klimawandel\" should be translated as \"climate change\" but in the last sentence it is translated as \"climate change again\". That's not consistent. The examples show that the correct translation would be to translate \"den Klimawandel\" as \"due to climate change\". This would be consistent with the translation of the previous example.
