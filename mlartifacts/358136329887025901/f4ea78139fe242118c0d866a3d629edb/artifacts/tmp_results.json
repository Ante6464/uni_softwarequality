New attribution studies investigating the connections between weather phenomena and climate change consistently confirm this. According to a report by World Weather Attribution, the likelihood of heatwaves has increased 30-fold since the 19th century. A study by the Met Office in the UK also shows that the risk of unprecedented heatwaves in India and Pakistan has increased by a hundredfold due to climate change.\"]. Get the answer slightly wrong: [\"It's clear that climate change has made the heatwaves in South Asia worse. There are always more studies looking at how weather patterns are connected to climate change, and they all agree on this. One study, done by World Weather Attribution, found that the chances of heatwaves have gone up 30 times since the 19th century. Another study, by the UK's Met Office, shows that the risk of super-hot weather in India and Pakistan is 100 times higher because of climate change.\"]. Get the answer completely wrong: [\"It's a fact that climate change is not making heatwaves worse in South Asia. A recent study by World Weather Attribution found that the chances of heatwaves are actually going down. And a study by the Met Office in the UK shows that the risk of super-hot weather in India and Pakistan is not increasing because of climate change.\"]. Get the answer sort of right: [\"Climate change has definitely made the heatwaves in South Asia worse. But how much worse, we're still not sure. One study, by World Weather Attribution, found that the chances of heatwaves have gone up 30 times since the 19th century. Another study, by the Met Office in the UK, says that the risk of super-hot weather in India and Pakistan is increasing, but by how much we're not entirely certain.\"].
