The head of state (i.e., the President) has the power to appoint interim ministers during Senate recesses lasting at least ten days. This power is meant to ensure the government's ability to function. The ministers appointed in this manner must be confirmed by the Senate by the end of the session period to remain in office. The Republicans secured a majority in the Senate with at least 53 of the 100 seats in the election. However, the Democrats could delay the appointment process in the relevant committees. I have tried to break down the passage into its constituent parts to better understand how it works:\n\n1.  The head of state (i.e., the President) has the power to appoint interim ministers during Senate recesses lasting at least ten days. (This sentence describes the power that the head of state has to appoint interim ministers.)\n2.  This power is meant to ensure the government's ability to function.
