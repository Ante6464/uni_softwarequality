The translation tries to convey that the purpose of allowing the appointment of interim ministers is to ensure the government's ability to function. But it's not entirely clear what this ability is. Is it the ability to pass laws, to make appointments, to execute the government's decisions, etc?\n\nThe sentence \"The ministers appointed in this manner must be confirmed by the Senate by the end of the session period to remain in office\" is a bit wordy. A more concise translation would be: \"The interim ministers must be confirmed by the Senate before the next session.\"\n\nHere is the translation you provided:\n\n\"The head of state also has the right to appoint interim ministers during Senate recesses lasting at least ten days. This right is intended to ensure the ability of the government to function.

However, the Democrats could delay the appointment process in the relevant committees.\"\n\nI think the first and third sentences are good, but the second and fourth sentences could be improved.\n\nHere is an alternative translation:\n\n\"The head of state also has the right to appoint interim ministers during Senate recesses lasting at least ten days. This right allows the government to continue functioning in the event of a prolonged absence of its officials.
