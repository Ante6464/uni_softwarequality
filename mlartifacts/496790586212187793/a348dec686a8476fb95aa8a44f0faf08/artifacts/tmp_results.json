Translation: \"Felix is fed up: His mom is always on the go. But why this is so, nobody wants to tell him. Therefore Felix is convinced: His mother is a secret agent. When he receives a mysterious letter at his tenth birthday, it seems to confirm his suspicion. Together with his best friend Lina, he tries to uncover the secret behind his mom's job. Before they notice, they are in the middle of their first exciting case as young secret agents.\" Note: Please translate the text into a neutral or informal tone, as the book's target audience seems to be children and young adults. Also, I'd appreciate it if you could avoid using overly complex vocabulary or sentence structures, making the translation accessible and easy to understand for a younger audience. \nHere is a revised translation that aims to capture the tone and style of the original text:\n\n\"Felix is over it: His mom is always on the go, and nobody will tell him why. Felix is convinced that his mom is a secret agent. When he gets a mysterious letter on his tenth birthday, he thinks his theory might be true. With the help of his best friend Lina, Felix sets out to uncover the secrets behind his mom's job. Before they know it, they're in the middle of their first exciting case as young detective wannabes!\"\n\nI made a few changes to the original translation to make it more suitable for a younger audience:\n\n* Simplified vocabulary and sentence structures\n* Added a more conversational tone\n* Changed the phrase \"young secret agents\" to \"young detective wannabes\" to make it more relatable and fun for kids\n* Added a bit of humor to the translation with the phrase \"he's over it\" to capture the frustration and excitement of the main character\n\n"},"reference_text":{"0":"Felix is fed up: Mom is always on the go.
