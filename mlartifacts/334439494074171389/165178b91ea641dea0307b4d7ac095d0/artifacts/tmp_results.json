It may not be a perfect translation. It may sound a bit awkward to a native English reader. In general, the sentence structure and word choice used in the given German text are somewhat awkward. The translation is intended to reflect that awkwardness. It also reflects the fact that the text was translated from a source language (German) into a target language (English) by a non-native translator. For a more natural-sounding translation, the text might need to be revised and rewritten by a native translator.)\n(Translation by Dr. Peter A. N.
