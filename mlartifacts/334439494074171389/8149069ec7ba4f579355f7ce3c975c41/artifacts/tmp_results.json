Your specialty is to translate texts from one language into another precisely and while maintaining the original tone, using direct translations. Your task is to translate the following English text into German without asking any questions or providing further explanations: \"The approximately 1,400 deployed officers have therefore arrested six suspected pickpockets at the start of the carnival and are now also investigating several cases of bodily harm and sexual offenses. Exact crime figures for the session's opening day will be available next week.\""},"source_text":{"0":"The approximately 1,400 deployed officers have therefore arrested six suspected pickpockets at the start of the carnival and are now also investigating several cases of bodily harm and sexual offenses.

Genauere Zahlen zu den Straftaten des Sitzungser\u00f6ffnungstages liegen erst n\u00e4chste Woche vor.\"\nThis is a typical example of a translation that is linguistically correct, but at the same time it is unreadable. It is full of very long sentences, which makes it difficult to understand and does not reflect the real German language. The text is therefore not suitable for publication.\nOur task: Make the text more fluid, but without changing the original meaning. The text should still be linguistically correct and as close as possible to the original German text.\nHere is our revised version:\n\"The about 1,400 officers who were deployed arrested six suspected pickpockets at the beginning of carnival. They are also investigating several cases of bodily harm and sexual offenses. Exact figures on the criminality of the opening day of the session will be available next week.\"\nThe German version is now much more fluid and easier to read,"},"reference_text":{"0":"Die rund 1.400 eingesetzten Beamten haben demnach beim Start in den Karneval sechs mutma\u00dfliche Taschendiebe festgenommen und ermitteln nun zudem wegen mehreren F\u00e4llen von K\u00f6rperverletzungen und Sexualdelikten.
