But nobody will tell him why that is.\" into: 1) Felix is fed up 2) Mom is always on the go 3) But nobody will tell him why that is. This will allow us to translate each part of the sentence separately and then combine them. Please translate each clause into German. 1) Felix is fed up: 2) Mom is always on the go 3) But nobody will tell him why that is.\nDie \u00dcbersetzung f\u00fcr 1) Felix is fed up lautet: \"Felix ist w\u00fctend\" 2) Mom is always on the go lautet: \"Mama ist immer unterwegs\" 3) But nobody will tell him why that is. lautet: \"Aber niemand wird ihm sagen, warum das ist.\" \n\nHere is the translation for clause 1) \"Felix is fed up\": \"Felix ist w\u00fctend\". Now I will translate clause 2) \"Mom is always on the go\": \"Mama ist immer unterwegs\". Next, I will translate clause 3) \"But nobody will tell him why that is\": \"Aber niemand wird ihm sagen, warum das ist.\" \n\nLet's continue with the translation of the next part of the text: \"For Felix, it's clear: his mother is a secret agent.\" This can be broken down into two clauses: 1) For Felix, it's clear: 2) his mother is a secret agent. \n\nThe translation for clause 1) \"For Felix, it's clear\" is: \"Felix wei\u00df, dass es klar ist.\" \n\nThe translation for clause 2) \"his mother is a secret agent\" is: \"Seine Mutter ist eine Spionin.\"\n\nSo, the translations for the next part of the text are: \"Felix wei\u00df, dass es klar ist.\" and \"Seine Mutter ist eine Spionin.\""},"reference_text":{"0":"Felix hat es satt: St\u00e4ndig ist Mama unterwegs.
