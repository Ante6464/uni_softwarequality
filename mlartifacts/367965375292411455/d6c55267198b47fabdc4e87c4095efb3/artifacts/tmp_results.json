Ever new attribution studies that examine the connections between weather phenomena and climate change are proving it. Thus, a report by World Weather Attribution showed that the probability of heat waves has increased by 30 times since the 19th century. And an attribution study conducted by the British Met Office shows that the risk of unprecedented heat waves in India and Pakistan has increased by one hundred times due to climate change.\"\nThis is an example of direct translation, in which every single word, every single sentence of the source text is translated into a target language, in this case English.\nThe task of translating this text may not be difficult for professional translators, but it can still be very time-consuming. Why? Because translators have to be careful with every single word, because even minor changes can have a major effect on the meaning.\nFurthermore, translating a text like this requires a lot of background knowledge and research because, as is often the case, technical terms have to be correctly translated into the target language, which is only possible if you have an in-depth understanding of the field in question.\nIn this case, the technical terms are climate change, heat wave, weather phenomena, attribution studies, and weather attribution. While the first three terms are easy to translate, the latter two require some research.\nIt is important to note that there are many more technical terms in the German text that have to be correctly translated into English.\nIn addition to the technical terms, there is another aspect that makes translating this text a difficult task.\nThis is the fact that there are several forms of the verb \"to stand\" in the German text, which have to be translated correctly into English. In the first sentence, the infinitive \"to stand\" is used, while the verb is conjugated in the past tense in the third sentence.\nAs you can see, translating this text is not as easy as it might seem, and it requires a lot of time and effort.If you want to translate a text like this, or any other text, contact us today.
