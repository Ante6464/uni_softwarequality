It is important to know that there is no doubt that climate change has strengthened these heat waves.\nThe text goes on to say that there are more and more studies that show the connection between weather phenomena and climate change. One example is a report by World Weather Attribution, which found that the probability of heat waves has increased 30 times since the 19th century. Another example is a study by the UK Met Office, which shows that the risk of unprecedented heat waves in India and Pakistan has increased a hundredfold due to climate change.\u201cThe fact that climate change has intensified heat waves in South Asia is beyond doubt. A growing number of attribution studies, which investigate the links between weather phenomena and climate change, confirm this. One such example is a report from World Weather Attribution, which found that the probability of heat waves has increased by a factor of 30 since the 19th century.
