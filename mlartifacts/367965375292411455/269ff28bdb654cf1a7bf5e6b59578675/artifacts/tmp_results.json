Your specialty is to translate texts from one language into another precisely and while maintaining the original tone, using direct translations. Your task is to translate the following English text into German without asking any questions or providing further explanations: \"There is no question that climate change is intensifying heatwaves in South Asia. Continuous attribution studies that examine the connections between weather phenomena and climate change confirm this. For example, a report by World Weather Attribution found that the likelihood of heatwaves has increased 30-fold since the 19th century. Additionally, an attribution study conducted by the UK's Met Office reveals that the risk of unprecedented heatwaves in India and Pakistan has increased 100-fold due to climate change.\""},"source_text":{"0":"There is no question that climate change is intensifying heatwaves in South Asia.

If you want to translate something from one language into another, you can't just use a dictionary. You have to pay attention to a lot of things to make the translation sound natural in the target language. You also have to make sure you understand the meaning of the source text.\nHere are some things you should consider when translating from English to German:\n- Word order: In German, the word order is often different from English. For example, the verb comes at the end of the sentence in German, while it comes in the middle of the sentence in English.\n- Prepositions: In German, prepositions are often used in different ways than in English. For example, the German preposition \"von\" is used to show possession, while the English preposition \"of\" is used in the same way.\n- Conjugation: In German, verbs are conjugated in different ways depending on the person and tense. In English, verbs are conjugated in a simpler way.\n- False friends: These are words that look and sound similar in both languages but have different meanings. For example, the German word \"bitte\" means \"please\" in English, while"},"reference_text":{"0":"Dass der Klimawandel die Hitzewellen in S\u00fcdasien verst\u00e4rkt, steht au\u00dfer Frage.
