The police are now investigating several cases of bodily harm and sexual offenses. More detailed crime figures for the carnival's opening will be reported next week. \n(Note: I translated \"Sessionsauftakt\" as \"carnival's opening\". If you think it's better to translate it as \"session opening\", please tell me, but in this context, \"carnival's opening\" seems to be more natural to me) \n\"Sessionsauftakt\" is a bit tricky, but in the context of Karneval, it's usually used to describe the beginning of the carnival season. In this case, \"carnival's opening\" seems to be a good translation. I agree with you. \n\nI translated \"demnach\" as \"according to reports\". Demnach is a subordinating conjunction that can be used to indicate the source of the information. In this case, it's followed by a clause that contains the word \"Start\", which is a key term in the text. \"According to reports\" seems to be a good way to translate it in this context. \n\nYou translated \"Sessionsauftakt\" as \"session opening\". I think \"carnival opening\" is a more natural translation"},"reference_text":{"0":"The approximately 1,400 deployed officers have therefore arrested six suspected pickpockets at the start of the carnival and are now also investigating several cases of bodily harm and sexual offenses.
