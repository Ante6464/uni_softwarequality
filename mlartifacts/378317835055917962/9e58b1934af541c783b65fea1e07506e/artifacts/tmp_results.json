Precise figures on the crime at the session start will be given in the next week.\" \nNote: I'm assuming that \"Sessionsauftakt\" is being used here in a figurative sense to mean the beginning of the carnival season. If you were to be more literal, it would be something like \"the session opening\". But I'm fairly certain the context is carnival season. \nAlso, \"demnach\" is a rather formal way of saying \"therefore\", but I translated it as \"therefore\" anyway, as it's somewhat idiomatic to use it in this way. If you'd like me to translate it more literally as \"according to that\", I can do so. Let me know! \nLastly, \"K\u00f6rperverletzungen\" literally means \"bodily harm\", but in this context it's more like \"assault\" or \"physical violence\". I translated it as \"bodily harm\" anyway, as it's a more general term"},"reference_text":{"0":"The approximately 1,400 deployed officers have therefore arrested six suspected pickpockets at the start of the carnival and are now also investigating several cases of bodily harm and sexual offenses.
