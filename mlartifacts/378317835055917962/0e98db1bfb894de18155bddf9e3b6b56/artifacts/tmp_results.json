However, in the context of a police report, \"Karneval\" would be more common and is used here. Additionally, \"session\" can be translated to \"Sitzung\" in German, which is a common term in the context of a court hearing or a trial. However, \"Sitzung\" can also be translated to \"Tagung\" or \"Versammlung\" in other contexts, but here it's clearly referring to the first day of a court hearing.
