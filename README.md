# Comparison of Large Language Model Prompting Techniques
Project by Justin Reichert and Fynn Aldenkirchs

This project, conducted as part of the Software Quality course, aims to investigate and compare various prompting techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs). 
By systematically evaluating different prompting strategies, we seek to understand how subtle variations in prompt design 
can significantly impact the quality and relevance of generated text.

## Setup
In the root directory of the project, you'll find an environment.yml file. You can use this file to create a conda environment with the following command:
```
conda env create --file environment.yml
```
This command will create an environment named _softwarequality_.
This environment can then be used to run the Jupyter Notebooks.
Afterwards, you can activate the environment with:
```
conda activate softwarequality
```
and set it as the default environment for your project in your chosen IDE.
